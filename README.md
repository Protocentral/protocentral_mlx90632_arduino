## Protocentral MLX90632

**ProtoCentral Infrared Non-Contact Thermometer (Qwiic) – MLX90632** is a miniature breakout for accurate non-contact temperature measurement, especially in thermally challenging environments.


It supports any microcontroller for interface with the integrated logic level converter on-board regulator and now compatible with an integrated QWIIC-connectors for complete compatibility with the QWIIC Ecosystem The temperature measured by MLX90632 is the average temperature of all the objects in its field of view. The wavelength pass band of the optical filter integrated into the sensor ranges from 2 to 14Î¼m.This board is directly compatible with the QWIIC connector standard from Sparkfun. This means easy plug-and-play usage with all QWIIC-compatible shields and boards.
